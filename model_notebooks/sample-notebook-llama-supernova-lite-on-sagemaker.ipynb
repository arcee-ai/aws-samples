    "# Using Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite on SageMaker through the Hugging Face hub\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook shows you how to deploy [Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite](https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai/Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite) using Amazon SageMaker. Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite is a conversational model developed by [Arcee.ai](https://www.arcee.ai). \n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite is an 8B parameter model developed by Arcee.ai, based on the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct architecture. It is a distilled version of the larger Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct model, leveraging offline logits extracted from the 405B parameter variant. This 8B variation of Llama-3.1-SuperNova maintains high performance while offering exceptional instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained using a state-of-the-art distillation pipeline and an instruction dataset generated with [EvolKit](https://github.com/arcee-ai/EvolKit), ensuring accuracy and efficiency across a wide range of tasks. For more information on its training, visit blog.arcee.ai. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite excels in both benchmark performance and real-world applications, providing the power of large-scale models in a more compact, efficient form ideal for organizations seeking high performance with reduced resource requirements.\n",

    "In this example, we're deploying Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite on a SageMaker real-time endpoint hosted on a GPU instance. If you need general information on real-time inference with Amazon SageMaker, please refer to the SageMaker [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deploy-model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The endpoint runs a Hugging Face [Deep Learning Container](https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/index), powered by the Hugging Face [Text Generation Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) Server (TGI). TGI enables high-performance text generation for the most popular open-source language models. \n",

    "For flexibility, you can pick from two sample configurations, depending your use case and the instances types available to you. Please make sure to run just one of the configuration cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### G5 endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The first configuration focuses on cost efficiency. It uses a [g5.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/) instance. This instance has a single NVDIA A10G GPU, with 24 GB of GPU RAM. Llama-Spark has 8 billion 16-bit parameters, which can easily fit without the need for quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For context size, we use the default value defined by the TGI inference server, i.e. 4K.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P4 endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The second configuration focuses on performance. It uses a [p4d.24xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/) instance. This instance has eight NVDIA A100 GPUs, with a total of 320 GB of GPU RAM. This is more than enough to load the model and use a much larger context size of 80K.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenAI compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "For both configurations, we enable the [OpenAI Messages API](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/messages_api) available in TGI. This will alllow you to invoke the endpoint in the same way you would invoke an OpenAI model. Likewise, the output format will be identical to the OpenAI models. If that's not desirable, you can simply comment out the line setting `MESSAGES_API_ENABLED` to `true`.\n",
