    "* **Coding**: Assisting with programming tasks, from code generation to debugging.\n",
    "* **General Language Understanding**: Comprehending and generating human-like text in diverse contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arcee-Nova can be applied to various business tasks:\n",
    "* **Customer Service**: Implement sophisticated chatbots and virtual assistants.\n",
    "* **Content Creation**: Generate high-quality written content for marketing and documentation.\n",
    "* **Software Development**: Accelerate coding processes and improve code quality.\n",
    "* **Data Analysis**: Enhance data interpretation and generate insightful reports.\n",
    "* **Research and Development**: Assist in literature reviews and hypothesis generation.\n",
    "* **Legal and Compliance**: Automate contract analysis and regulatory compliance checks.\n",
    "* **Education and Training**: Create adaptive learning systems and intelligent tutoring programs.\n",

    "In this example, we're deploying Arcee-Nova on a SageMaker real-time endpoint hosted on a GPU instance. If you need general information on real-time inference with Amazon SageMaker, please refer to the SageMaker [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deploy-model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The endpoint runs a Hugging Face [Deep Learning Container](https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/index), powered by the Hugging Face [Text Generation Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) Server (TGI). TGI enables high-performance text generation for the most popular open-source language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "For flexibility, you can pick from two sample configurations, depending your use case and the instances types available to you. Please make sure to run just one of the configuration cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### G5 endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The first configuration focuses on cost efficiency. It uses a [g5.12xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/) instance. This instance has four NVDIA A10G GPUs, with a total of 96 GB of GPU RAM. Nova has 72 billion 16-bit parameters, which cannot fit in 96GB. Thus, we apply 4-bit quantization to the model, and shrink it by a factor of 4! \n",
    "\n",
    "For context size, we use the default value defined by the TGI inference server, i.e. 4 KB.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P4 endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "The second configuration focuses on performance. It uses a [p4d.24xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/) instance. This instance has eight NVDIA A100 GPUs, with a total of 320 GB of GPU RAM. This is more than enough to load the full precision model, and we can also use a much larger context size: 3 2KB.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenAI compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "For both configurations, we enable the [OpenAI Messages API](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/messages_api) available in TGI. This will alllow you to invoke the endpoint in the same way you would invoke an OpenAI model. Likewise, the output format will be identical to the OpenAI models. If that's not desirable, you can simply comment out the line setting `MESSAGES_API_ENABLED` to `true`.\n",
