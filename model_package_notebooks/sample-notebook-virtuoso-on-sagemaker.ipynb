    "# Using Arcee.ai Virtuoso Models on SageMaker through Model Packages\n",
    "*The latest version of this notebook is available on [Github](https://github.com/arcee-ai/aws-samples/tree/main/model_package_notebooks).*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to deploy the [Arcee.ai](https://www.arcee.ai) Virtuoso models listed on [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-r7b33ivdczgs6). You must have previously subscribed to the appropriate model to deploy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virtuoso models are general-purpose, high-performance models that excel in both benchmark performance and real-world applications. They bring you the same quality as much larger models in a more compact form ideal for organizations looking for both performance and cost efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are available in three sizes, all with a 128K token context size:\n",
    "* **Virtuoso Large:** Best-in-class frontier model.\n",
    "* **Virtuoso Medium**: Mid-tier general-purpose performance at a lower cost. \n",
    "* **Virtuoso Small**: Optimized for lightweight tasks and faster inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are deployed to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.  If you need general information on real-time inference with SageMaker, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deploy-model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you already deployed the model package with CloudFormation, the AWS CLI or directly in the AWS console, there is no need to deploy it again with this notebook. For inference, please use the [sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb](sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb) notebook instead.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases\n",
    "The Virtuoso models are suitable for a wide range of language tasks, demonstrating particular strength in:\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: Solving complex problems and drawing logical conclusions.\n",
    "* **Creative Writing**: Generating engaging and original content across various genres.\n",
    "* **General Language Understanding**: Comprehending and generating human-like text in diverse contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be applied to various business tasks such as:\n",
    "* **Customer Service**: Implement sophisticated chatbots and virtual assistants.\n",
    "* **Content Creation**: Generate high-quality written content for marketing and documentation.\n",
    "* **Data Analysis**: Enhance data interpretation and generate insightful reports.\n",
    "* **Research and Development**: Assist in literature reviews and hypothesis generation.\n",
    "* **Legal and Compliance**: Automate contract analysis and regulatory compliance checks.\n",
    "* **Education and Training**: Create adaptive learning systems and intelligent tutoring programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "1. This notebook works for models listed on AWS Marketplace. Please make sure you have previously subscribed to the appropriate model.\n",
    "1. Ensure that IAM role attached to this notebook has the **AmazonSageMakerFullAccess** IAM policy.\n",
