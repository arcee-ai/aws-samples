    "# Using Llama-Spark on SageMaker through Model Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you already deployed the model package with CloudFormation, the AWS CLI or directly in the SageMaker console, please use the [sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb](sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb) notebook instead.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook shows you how to deploy [Llama Spark](https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai/Llama-Spark) using Amazon SageMaker. Llama-Spark is a conversational model developed by [Arcee.ai](https://www.arcee.ai). It excels at engaging in natural and informative conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-Spark is built on the foundation of Llama-3.1-8B and merges the power of our Tome Dataset with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, resulting in a remarkable conversationalist that punches well above its 8B parameter weight class. The model has a 128 KB  context size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases\n",
    "Llama-Spark excels across a wide range of language tasks, demonstrating particular strength in:\n",
    "* **Reasoning**: Solving complex problems and drawing logical conclusions.\n",
    "* **Creative Writing**: Generating engaging and original content across various genres.\n",
    "* **Coding**: Assisting with programming tasks, from code generation to debugging.\n",
    "* **General Language Understanding**: Comprehending and generating human-like text in diverse contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-Spark can be applied to various business tasks:\n",
    "* **Customer Service**: Implement sophisticated chatbots and virtual assistants.\n",
    "* **Content Creation**: Generate high-quality written content for marketing and documentation.\n",
    "* **Software Development**: Accelerate coding processes and improve code quality.\n",
    "* **Data Analysis**: Enhance data interpretation and generate insightful reports.\n",
    "* **Research and Development**: Assist in literature reviews and hypothesis generation.\n",
    "* **Legal and Compliance**: Automate contract analysis and regulatory compliance checks.\n",
    "* **Education and Training**: Create adaptive learning systems and intelligent tutoring programs.\n",
    "\n",
