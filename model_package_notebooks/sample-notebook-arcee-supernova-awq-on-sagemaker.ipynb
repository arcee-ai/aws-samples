    "\n",
    "**If you already deployed the model package with CloudFormation, the AWS CLI or directly in the SageMaker console, please use the [sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb](sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb) notebook instead.**\n",

    "\n",
    "This sample notebook shows you how to deploy Arcee SuperNova using Amazon SageMaker. Here, we use a 4-bit version quantized with [AutoAWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ), small enough to run on cost-effective 4-GPU instances of the g5 and g6 families.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arcee-SuperNova is an advanced general language model developed by Arcee AI, offering superior performance, customization, and security compared to traditional closed-source models. It excels in instruction following and human preference scores, outperforming Llama 70B-Instruct, as well Llama 405B, Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o in many general benchmarks. SuperNova also provides businesses with the option for deep customization on their data and use cases, seamless integration into existing systems, and top-tier security & compliance. It's ideal for industries with stringent security requirements, data-driven companies, and businesses seeking cost efficiency, offering up to 95% cost reduction compared to closed-source models.\n",

    "## Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ideal for industries with stringent security requirements (finance, healthcare, government)\n",
    "* Perfect for data-driven companies requiring tailored AI models\n",
    "* Suitable for businesses seeking cost efficiency without compromising performance\n",
