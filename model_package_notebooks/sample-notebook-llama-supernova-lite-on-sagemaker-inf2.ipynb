    "# Using Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite on SageMaker and Inferentia2 through Model Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you already deployed the model package with CloudFormation, the AWS CLI or directly in the SageMaker console, please use the [sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb](sample-notebook-all-models-existing-sagemaker-endpoint.ipynb) notebook instead.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook shows you how to deploy [Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite](https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai/Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite) using Amazon SageMaker. Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite is a conversational model developed by [Arcee.ai](https://www.arcee.ai). \n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite is an 8B parameter model developed by Arcee.ai, based on the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct architecture. It is a distilled version of the larger Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct model, leveraging offline logits extracted from the 405B parameter variant. This 8B variation of Llama-3.1-SuperNova maintains high performance while offering exceptional instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained using a state-of-the-art distillation pipeline and an instruction dataset generated with [EvolKit](https://github.com/arcee-ai/EvolKit), ensuring accuracy and efficiency across a wide range of tasks. For more information on its training, visit blog.arcee.ai. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-3.1-SuperNova-Lite excels in both benchmark performance and real-world applications, providing the power of large-scale models in a more compact, efficient form ideal for organizations seeking high performance with reduced resource requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "1. This notebook works for models listed in SageMaker JumpStart and on AWS Marketplace. If you'd like to deploy from AWS Marketplace, please make sure you have previously subscribed to the model.\n",
    "1. **Note**: This notebook contains elements which render correctly in Jupyter interface. Open this notebook from an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance or Amazon SageMaker Studio.\n",
    "1. Ensure that IAM role used has **AmazonSageMakerFullAccess**.\n",
